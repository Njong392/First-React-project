# My Very First React app

The purpose of this project was solely for learning reasons, but it'll mark the first project I made with React. I added tailwind as an extra touch.

# Project Overview

<p>It's a simple example consisting of the `useState` hook in React. Below is a simple screenshot</p>
<img src="" alt="Heading says 'My first React App' and includes a button that increments a counter." width="800" align="center"/>

# Tech Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- A (a teeny) bit of effort
